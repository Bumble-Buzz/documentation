# Asset

An asset is a Non-Fungible Token (NFT). All valid NFTs can be traded at BumbleBuzz.

All NFTs are associated with a collection. All collections must undergo a verification process to determine whether the collection is verified or unverified. Depending on the status of the collection the associated NFTs are then considered verified or unverified.&#x20;

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Verified" %}
If the asset belongs to a collection that is `verified`, then this asset will also be considered as `verified`.&#x20;

There is a visual representation of this on the NFT itself to give users confidence that this NFT has been vetted.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Unverified" %}
If this asset does not belong to any verified collection, the asset will then be considered as `unverified`.

There is a visual representation of this on the NFT itself to warn users that this NFT has not been vetted.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
