# Reflection

Collection owners have the ability to enable the reflection commission, which will result in all NFT owners earning rewards every time an NFT is sold associated with that collection.

A reflection is a form of incentive for users to hold NFTs. Given a successful sale for a collection where reflection is enabled, a set percent is taken out from the final sale price and is then distributed to the owners of other NFTs that belong to this collection.

> Example:
>
> Collection where reflection is enabled and is set to 2%. There are 10 NFTs in this collection
>
> NFT is sold for $100.\
> Holder of every NFT will receive = ($100\*0.02)/10 = $0.2
