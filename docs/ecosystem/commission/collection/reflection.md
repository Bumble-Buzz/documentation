# Reflection

Given that the collection owner has enabled reflection and has set the `reflection commission` percent, then owners of NFT holders of this collection can collect rewards.

Reflection is a form of incentive for users to hold NFTs. Given a successful sale for a collection where reflection is enabled, a set percent is taken out from the final sale price and is then distributed to the owners of other NFTs that belong to this collection.

> Example:
>
> Collection where reflection is enabled and set to 2%. There are 10 NFTs in this collection
>
> NFT is sold for $100.\
> Holder of every NFT will receive = ($100\*0.02)/10 = $0.2
