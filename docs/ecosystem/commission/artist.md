# Artist

If you create a NFT on BumbleBuzz, you are considered an artist of that NFT asset. Part of the creation of the NFT, you as the artist have an option to set an `artist commission` percent.

Given a valid `artist commission` percent value, every time this NFT is sold, you as an artist will claim the set percent from the final sale price. This commission will be rewarded to the artist on every successful sale.
