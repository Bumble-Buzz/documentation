# Collection

As a collection owner, you have an option to turn on `collection incentives` if you wish.

Given a valid `collection incentive` percent value, every time this NFT is sold, funds will be taken out of the `collection incentive pool`  to help towards the buyer. This will help to counter against collection commissions.
