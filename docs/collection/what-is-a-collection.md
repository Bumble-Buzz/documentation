# Collection

A collection is a representation of an `ERC 721` contract. Every verified `ERC 721` contract on BumbleBuzz has a collection associated with it.

There are 3 types of collections. Each type of collection can be considered as a bucket, and each bucket contains one or more collections.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Verified" %}
Varified bucket consists of verified collections only.

Creator seeking verification for their `ERC 721` contract on BumbleBuzz must submit their creations for verification.

All verified collections will be marked as `verified`. This means the NFTs belonging to the verified collection have been reviewed and approved as authentic by Bumblebuzz. All verified NFTs present with a verified mark on them for users interested in varified NFTs.&#x20;
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Unverified" %}
The unverified bucket consists of only one collection.&#x20;

All unverified NFTs are associated with this collection. All NFTs are considered unverified until they have gone through the verification process successfully.

All unverified NFTs have a red warning symbol to warn users.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Local" %}
The local bucket consists of only one collection.

All NFTs created through BumbleBuzz are associated with the local collection.&#x20;

This collection has special rules in place to give out artist commissions. All NFTs minted on the website and automatically marked as verified.
