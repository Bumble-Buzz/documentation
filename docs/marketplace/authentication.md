# Authentication

In order to interact with the BumbleBuzz NFT marketplace, you will need to install the Web3 MetaMask wallet. Please visit their official website for download and guidance: [https://metamask.io/](https://metamask.io/)

Once you have the MetaMask wallet installed, use it to connect to the BumbleBuzz app.

In order to authenticate, click on the profile icon located on the top right corner of the website. And then click `Sign` i`n`.

Once you click `SIGN`, you would be authenticated on BumbleBuzz. If this is your first time authenticating, your profile will be created. If you have authenticated before, your profile details will be loaded.
